My submission contains one extra function (getData.R). It retreives the data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and filters it to the relevant data needed for the assignment 
(using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02)

All 4 plot functions assume this function has been executed and that the reduced dataset (powerData.txt) is available in the working directory

This approach is more maintainable and reduces processing time to regenerate the plots
